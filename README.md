- 👋 Hi, I’m @SwapnilB31 (Swapnil Bhattacharjee). I am from Guwahati, India

- I work most of the time with JavaScript, Python, PHP and C++.
- My interests lie in Full Stack Development and I mostly work with React/Angular on the Front-End and Node.js, Flask or PHP in the backend.
- I believe in using the correct tool for the Job and that one size doesn't fit all. That's why I pick my databases based on the requirements of the project. I have developed projects using MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB and Dynamo DB.
- I am also interested in Mobile Application Development and have experience with Ionic/Cordova and React-Native in building Hybrid Mobile Apps.
- I am currently learning Flutter and Vue.js. And plan to learn GraphQL in the near future.
- You can reach me at [swapnilbhattacharjee187@gmail.com](mailto:swapnilbhattacharjee187@gmail.com) or [swapnilbhatt134@gmail.com](swapnilbhatt134@gmail.com)
- Here's a short list of some my projects. Most of them are on this repository, but some are on other repositories that I have contributed to.
  * [SQLNavigator](https://github.com/SwapnilB31/SQLNavigator): It's a light weight DBA Tool written in Java and used to work with MySQL, Microsoft SQL and Oracle. It was developed in 2016-17 as part of my requirements for my undergraduate studies. The project is now deprecated and no longer maintained. Breaking changes in Java 10 for JavaFX rendered the application unsuable with modern JREs and updates in the JDBC bridge for the different DB vendors has also affected its usability. The source code is still up there and is a part of my formative years as a developer.
  * [NITTMessApp](https://github.com/NITTMessApp/MessApp): A hybrid Mobile App Developed with Ionic/Cordova for the daily dining need of NIT Trichy students in their mess halls. It is designed to replace the traditional system of messcards with QR Tokens generated on the server for all the meals. It also had these features: monthly Mess Registration, Mess Reduction, Saving Tokens, Dining History and Registration History. Available for download on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitt.mess1&hl=en).
  * [node-file-tree](https://github.com/SwapnilB31/node-file-tree): A package for Node.js that converts file/directory structure into JavaScript objects, in addition to many useful methods that aid in customizing the output. Works on both windows and linux machines. Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-file-tree-explorer).
  * [react-file-picker](https://github.com/SwapnilB31/react-file-picker): Simple file picker that lets users pick files from a directory tree. Supports navigation inside a nested file structure and allows for customizations such as filtering files based on extension and custom icons for different file types. Can be used as the UI for accessing the file system of a file server that has the navigation logic built into it, you just need to pass into it a function that will return the directory entries for a given path. Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-file-picker-ui).
  * [covid-vaccine-appointment-notifier](https://github.com/SwapnilB31/covid-vaccine-appointment-notifier): A node.js app that notifies you about available covid vaccine appointment slots in India, as and when they become available.

  * [Book My Vaccine](https://github.com/SwapnilB31/BookMyVaccine): Book My Vaccine is an android application built with React-Native that notifies you of vaccination
