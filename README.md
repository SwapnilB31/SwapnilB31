# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Swapnil Bhattacharjee (@SwapnilB31)

I‚Äôm a **Full-Stack Engineer** from Guwahati, India with 4+ years of experience building scalable microservices, APIs, and event-driven systems. My work spans across **TypeScript, Node.js, Python, and React**, with a strong focus on **cloud-native applications** on **AWS** and **GCP**.

I specialize in:
- Architecting **HIPAA-compliant, serverless, and cost-efficient** solutions  
- Building **data-intensive backends** with GraphQL, gRPC, and event-driven pipelines  
- Designing **DevOps workflows** using Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions  
- Picking the **right database for the job** ‚Äî from Postgres and Aurora RDS to Neptune, MongoDB, and Redis  

On the frontend, I‚Äôve worked extensively with **React**, **Material UI**, and **modern state/data management patterns**.
